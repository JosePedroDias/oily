## TL;DR

A multiplayer game over network. Can be played alone as well.
Players are placed underground and have the objective of digging dirt so that oil reaches their tower(s).
First player to capture 100 oil gallons win.

Each player can move either digging or placing dirt.
There's a maximum amount of holes one can perform so use your potential carefully and fetch more from caves in the map.
Players can't move past oil so don't get yourself surrounded by it!

This game intended to be a submission to the [multiplayer game jam](https://itch.io/jam/multiplayer-jam) 🤞.

_Controls_ ⌨️

- `arrows` move the player
- `space bar` toggles between placing and digging dirt (having reached 0 holes the mode switches for you as well)
- `R` starts a new map (if you get stuck for instance). Please don't use it during a game 🙏

## TODO 🧑‍🍳

- title screen 🇴 🇮 🇱 🇾 (ongoing...)
- instructions 📃
- eyecandy 🌈
  - fullscreen toggle
  - hint exact placement of extraction (vertical line in tower)
  - add a sky texture
  - use textures instead of solid colors for materials (https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.polygon + texture vs surface stencil)
  - close in camera according to action context
- network 🕸
  - for now 2 slots in a single channel/session. additional people wait for turn to enter
  - remove space btw cmd and args in netcode
- game overs detection 💀
  - player between oil
  - no more holes (player spent theirs and oil filled map holes)
- procedural map 🗺
  - confirm oil starts not in/surrounded by cave (not REQUIRED)
  - more than one tower per player? (may be confusing)
